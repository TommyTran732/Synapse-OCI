[Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) implementation written in Python.

### Notes
- Prebuilt images are available at `ghcr.io/tommytran732/synapse`.
- Don't trust random images: build yourself if you can.
- Always keep your software up-to-date: manage versions with [build-time variables](https://github.com/TommyTran732/Synapse-Docker/blob/main/Dockerfile#L1-L4).

### Features & usage
- Drop-in replacement for the [official image](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/develop/docker).
- Unprivileged image: you should check your volumes permissions (eg `/data`), default UID/GID is 991.
- Based on the latest [Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/) containers which provide more recent packages while having less attack surface.
- Daily rebuilds keeping the image up-to-date.
- Comes with the [hardened memory allocator](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc) built from the latest tag, protecting against some heap-based buffer overflows.
- [Mjolnir module](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/blob/main/docs/synapse_module.md) support.
